# MemoryGame

This is classic Memory Game with three levels of difficulty. The game was created in React JS framework. Webpack with Sass (CSS preprocessor) was used to improve the efficiency of work and the quality of code. The code were refactored to be clearer and shorter.

As in every Memory Game you need to find to matching pairs. Two pictures are identical so you just need to concentrate on the position of a picture. You have three levels of difficulty to choose from. Have fun!
